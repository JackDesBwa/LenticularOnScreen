This project aims to create a 3D monitor thanks to a lenticular sheet on it.

It is inspired by a project by Mercy Yamada, whose sources were found on (obscure!) japanese site.
You can find original sources in history of NAE branch. This branch contains modifications to make it work on my computer as well as editions to help understanding it.
